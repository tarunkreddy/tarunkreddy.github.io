			Building a PC can be a challenging experience, especially for a beginner. Even if you manage to overcome the 
		   task of figuring out the parts to use for your PC, putting those parts together and making sure they all work 
		   is difficult. We aim to solve that problem. <br><br>
		
			We offer a full-experience service, from figuring out the right PC build for your budget and usage, to actually 
			putting it together, and finally setting it up with all the software you'll need so that it works the moment you get
			your hands on it.

		<h1>August 2019 Build</h1>
		<div class="text-container">
			This build was completed for an acquaintance transitioning from Xbox who had no idea where to start with a PC. 
			Based on the games he wanted to play (Destiny 2 and CS:GO) and his budget, we were able to put together a parts list, 
			order his parts, and put together his PC in just a week! This system is capable of playing most games at 1440p at 100+ Hz,
			and cost around $1100, excluding peripherals like a monitor, mouse, and keyboard.

		<h1>July 2019 Build</h1>
		<div class="text-container">
			This is one of more expensive builds. Our client requested the highest possible spec to play the newest games at the highest 
			resolution and framerate possible. Due to some of these parts being out of stock, this took a little longer to build, almost 2 weeks, 
			but we were able to use our connections to get the hard to find parts into the build. This build cost around $2700, and is capable of playing 
			most games at 4K/60+Hz, or 1440p/240+Hz.
