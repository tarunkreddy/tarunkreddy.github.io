		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<div class="text-container">
			We are a group of 5 tech enthusiasts who have all built our own PCs. After going through the experience alone
			each time, we realized that the amount of time and effort was simply not going to be worth it for most people,
			and the risk that something could go wrong was too high, considering the cost of the system. That's why we 
			started GGPC. We wanted to make an affordable PC building service for people just getting into the hobby, but
			we needed to differentiate ourselves from a standard tech shop. That's why we also provide a service at the very 
			beginning of your experience. A member of our team will go through your goals for your PC, as well as your budget, and 
			help you figure out the best parts for your build.
